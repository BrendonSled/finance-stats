# [Finance Stats](https://financestats.netlify.com/)

The purpose of this repository is to create a financial website that mimics those like [RobinHood](https://Robinhood.com) and [IEX Trading](https://iextrading.com) using the [iex API](https://iextrading.com/developer/docs) to fetch real-time data.
